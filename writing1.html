                    <p>It’s your first day of baseball. As you walk 
					through the gate, you can already smell the packed 
					dirt, the chalk base lines, the leather of a dozen 
					mitts. Your dad’s fingers are wrapped around yours 
					as you make the trip to the dugout, where several 
					other five and six year olds have lined up. He 
					carries the duffel bag you packed so carefully the 
					night before, while your mom follows close behind 
					with enough camera equipment to film a movie. That 
					morning you had laid out everything you would need 
					on the floor of your room, your mom checking items 
					off of the list:</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Mitt?		Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Uniform?	Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Sneakers?	Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Water?		Check</p>
				<p>The entire five years of your life have been spent 
				preparing for this moment. Running after your baby 
				brother in the playground. Playing catch on those late 
				summer evenings. Watching the Mets actually win games 
				at Shea Stadium.</p>
				<p>Walking into the dugout, all you can see are boys: 
				boys with their parents bent over their feet, tying 
				their shoes; boys sticking their hands into their new 
				gloves; boys staring unabashedly at the plastic bag of 
				snacks stashed under the bench. At the end of the bench, 
				a solitary girl sits, pulling her baseball hat carefully 
				over her ponytail. You meet her eyes, smile, and rush to 
				grab the seat next to her.</p>
				<p>You’re ready to play ball.</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">*	*	*	*</p>
				<p>As a six year old, your hair is very important. Some 
				girls wear it down, ornamented with headbands, barrettes, 
				and ribbons of various colors. Others choose to put their 
				hair into smooth braids, but there is a stark difference 
				between the one-braiders, the two-braiders, and the corn 
				rowers. The corn rowers have intense hair, their heads weighed 
				down by dozens of thin, little braids each finished with a bead. 
				Then there are the ponytails.</p>
				<p>You wear your hair in a ponytail, but it’s not a typical 
				ponytail—you didn’t brush through your hair for three seconds, 
				wrap a rubber band around it, and call it a day. Your ponytail 
				is a meticulous, time-consuming project…for your mom at least.</p>
				<p>You spent that particular Saturday morning perched on the edge 
				of one of the dining room chairs as your mom ran the brush through 
				your hair, eventually tying it up into a ponytail. This process 
				was repeated several times until the ponytail met your standards. 
				Normally, your ponytail needed to be smooth to the touch. You 
				didn’t want to find a stray hair when, during the day, you decided 
				to run your hand over your hair. But today was especially important, 
				because you were going to ballet. Your mom had to do, redo, and redo 
				your hair before its quality was ensured, given the 
				see-if-it-falls-off-if-I-shake-my-head-really-hard stamp of approval.</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Leotard?	Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Tights?		Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Slippers?	Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Hair?	Double check</p>
				<p>By the time you reached your ballet class, your stomach felt 
				like it was about to explode from all of the butterflies you’d 
				swallowed on the bus ride. Practicing arabesques and pliés in front 
				of the parallel-universe-class you saw in the mirror was no sweat 
				(just a lot of muscle pain afterwards). But performing the same 
				exact routine with the same exact people in the same exact room with 
				the same exact background music in front of a group of parents with 
				their index fingers glued to their cameras and video cameras? Horrifying.</p>
				<p>Back straight, toes pointed, arms above your head. Chin out, eyes 
				ahead, smile wide. Stay in your line. Listen to the music, feel the 
				beat, hear your teacher’s fervent snaps. 5, 6, 7, 8, go. Point your 
				toe now. Twirl here. Plié, releve, and stand. Arabesque. Up on your 
				toes, twirl. Face the audience and curtsy.</p>
				<p>A smattering of applause erupts from the rows of parents, camera 
				shutters clicking away to get the perfect shot of their perfect daughter 
				curtsying perfectly.</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">*	*	*	*</p>
				<p>“2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate? Flyingpurplepeopleeaters! 
				Flyingpurplepeopleeaters! Go Flyingpurplepeopleeaters!” You grimace 
				as the other team’s hands fly up into the air, “appreciating” your 
				team. It was not your decision to name your team after a popular 
				Halloween song. The stars on the sleeves of your purple soccer 
				jersey spoke of the Purple Stars, or the Shooting Stars, or a team 
				name that did not consist of four random words.</p>
				<p>Despite the effort the other team put into rushing through the name, 
				it still didn’t deaden the thump of victory in your ears. Adrenaline 
				still running high, people high-fived each other left and right on the 
				way to the trophy ceremony. It was a crushing win for the Flying Purple 
				People Eaters, nothing new. As the only team with two fifth graders, 
				the Flying Purple People Eaters had a huge advantage over the wimpy 
				fourth grade teams.</p>
				<p>The rest of the girls look up to you, starting conversations as you 
				walk with them to the coach. A box of trophies at his feet, the chatter 
				dies down and he begins to hand out the cheap flags the soccer league 
				had used instead of trophies this year. With “FLYING PURPLE PEOPLE EATERS” 
				emblazoned in huge letters, the ceremony has no personalization, no 
				mini speech for each player. The team acts like an assembly line: left 
				hand, flag; right hand, team photos; stand next to coach for a few 
				seconds while your parents frantically snap pictures on their smartphones.</p>
				<p>You remember a former teammate of yours, Rachel. Whenever someone got 
				injured, whether they were on your team on not, she would go down on 
				one knee, head bent, hands clapping. During the first few years of 
				soccer, by the end of the game, everyone’s knees would be disgusting, 
				covered in cuts and bruises from stealing the ball or falling on your 
				face, caked in dusty mud. As the years passed, the girls got older, 
				the games fell into a routine, and the knees were no longer dirty.</p> 
				<p style="text-align:center">*	*	*	*</p>
				<p>It’s your first day of softball. As you walk through the gate, you 
				can already smell the packed dirt, the chalk base lines, the leather 
				of a dozen mitts. Your dad’s fingers are wrapped around your little 
				sister’s as you make the trip to the dugout, where several other nine 
				and ten year olds have lined up. He carries the duffel bag you packed 
				so carefully the next before, while your mom follows close behind with 
				enough camera equipment to film a movie. That morning you had laid out 
				everything you would need on the floor of your room, your mom checking 
				items off of the list:</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Mitt?		Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Uniform?	Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Sneakers?	Check</p>
				<p style="text-align:center">Water?		Check</p>
				<p>The entire ten years of your life have been spent preparing for 
				this moment. Working on your flexibility and agility in ballet. 
				Practicing yelling at each other from across the field. Being the best 
				on a team consisting of all boys, except for you.</p>
				<p>Walking into the dugout, all you can see are girls: girls unloading 
				their bats and gloves; girls rolling softballs around in their palms; 
				girls gathered in groups, talking about their plans for the summer. At 
				the end of the bench, a group of new girls sit, pulling their visors 
				carefully over their ponytails. They all look up at the sound of your 
				sneakers smacking against the concrete floor of the dugout and smile. 
				You rush over to their group, bag in hand, an introduction already 
				rolling off of your tongue.</p>
				<p>You’re ready to play ball.</p>
				<p>It’s June, three months after the first day. By now, you know 
				all of the boys on the team. You aren’t “girl #1”—you’re just another 
				player on the Coronas. The hours you’ve spent fielding, batting, 
				catching, throwing, yelling at people, getting yelled at—they all 
				culminate to this very moment: trophies.</p>
				<p>Coach Ken stands in the middle of the field, a small circle of players and 
				parents forming around him. He pulls out a trophy at random. “First up 
				is, Nick!” The speech begins to flow, peppered with laughter and 
				anecdotes about Nick’s season on the Coronas, and ends with a trophy 
				being handed, a photo being taken, and applause all around.</p>
				<p>The cycle continues. One by one, the players stand up, listen to 
				their speeches, and take their trophies, eagerly clutching them to 
				their chests. It’s finally down to you and Caroline, the other girl 
				on the team.</p>
				<p>“Last, but most certainly not least, are the two most important 
				players on this team: Caitlin and Caroline.” A smile is plastered onto 
				your face and you take your place next to Coach. He smiles down at you.</p>
				<p>“They taught the boys how to play baseball.”</p>
